# bittensor-mining-tutorial

Welcome to the `bittensor-mining-tutorial` repository by TensorTeacher! This repository is specifically designed for individuals new to mining on Bittensor. Here, you will find comprehensive tutorials and scripts to help you get started with mining on the Bittensor network.

## About Bittensor

Bittensor is a decentralized neural network that allows users to train and deploy machine learning models in a distributed manner. It utilizes a peer-to-peer network where participants can contribute computational resources and receive rewards in return.

## Roadmap

The following are the planned milestones for this repository. Checkboxes will be marked upon completion of each task:

- [ ] **Base Script for Center Endpoint**: A foundational script will be provided to guide you in setting up a center endpoint on net 1. This will enable you to efficiently manage multiple miners and enhance your mining experience.

- [ ] **Step-by-Step Mining Tutorial**: A detailed and documented tutorial will be provided, offering precise instructions on how to set up your mining operations for the first time. This tutorial will cover all the necessary steps to get your mining activities up and running smoothly.

- [ ] **Adding Your Own Model to the Center Endpoint**: Instructions will be provided to guide you through the process of integrating your own machine learning model with the center endpoint. This will allow you to contribute your unique model to the Bittensor network and participate in the decentralized neural network ecosystem.

## Contributions

I am open to suggestions and feedback! If you have any specific topics or areas you would like to learn more about regarding mining on Bittensor, feel free to share your thoughts. Your suggestions will help shape the content of future tutorials and scripts.

Please note that this repository is primarily focused on mining on the Bittensor network. For general inquiries about Bittensor or other related topics, it is recommended to refer to the official Bittensor documentation or seek support from the Bittensor community.

Let's embark on this mining journey together and explore the exciting world of decentralized neural networks with Bittensor!
